# Steering Committee
The Steering Committee (SC) is the leadership body of the NTC. Its members
serve 1-year terms, running from October 1st to September 30th the following
year, during which they report to the National Political Committee (NPC) and
are responsible for coordinating between the NPC, DSA's national membership,

technological needs of the organization.
