# Welcome to the DSA National Tech Committee!

This page is to help onboard you and get you acclimated.

This handbook is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document). It’s likely that some processes will seem foggy, unresponsive or just poorly-documented. Other documentation will fall out of date. When you see something like this, please follow the steps in the [How to Contribute article](./contributing.md) to help us improve.
