On Zoom meetings, this may be done by typing \"Stack\" into the chat. However, the facilitator does not simply write a list of names in the order that people raise their hand. Rather, if someone who has not spoken raises their hand, they go to the top of the list. If someone who is of an oppressed group raises their hand, they go to the top of the list unless they have already contributed significantly to the discussion.</p>"},{"location":"code-of-conduct/#have-a-sense-of-humor","title":"Have a sense of humor","text":"<p>Who said movement building can\u2019t be fun?
